<h2 id="l">l</h2>

<p>Apple retains its leadership spot for the third year in a
row among platform operators. Both Apple and Google
continue to lead the sector in matching their growth
with an equivalent or larger supply of renewable energy,
and both companies continue to use their influence to
push governments as well as their utility and IT sector
vendors to increase access to renewable energy for
their operations.</p>

<h2 id="2">2</h2>

<p>Switch, new to the Clicking Clean report this year, scored
among the highest for any class of company and is the
definitive leader among colocation operators for its
efforts to transition its data center fleet to renewables
as fast as possible through a combination of renewable
energy procurement and aggressive advocacy</p>

<h2 id="3">3</h2>

<p>Major internet companies’ leadership has been a
catalyst in driving a broader set of corporations to
adopt 100% renewable goals, contributing to a dramatic
increase in renewable deals in the U.S. signed directly by
corporations, totally 3.4GW of renewable deals signed in
2015, with over two-thirds of this power from renewable
deals by IT companies.</p>

<h2 id="4">4</h2>

<p>Cloud computing market leader Amazon Web Services
(AWS) took some important steps in the past year,
including promising leadership in supporting clean
energy policy. But given AWS’s continued lack of
transparency and its rapid growth in Virginia and other
markets largely served by dirty energy, it remains
unclear whether the AWS cloud is actually on a path to
becoming renewably powered.</p>

<h2 id="5">5</h2>

<p>Video streaming is a tremendous driver of data demand,
with 63% of global internet traffic in 2015, and is
projected to reach 80% by 2020.7 Netflix alone already
accounts for over one-third of internet traffic in North
America8 and is in the midst of a worldwide expansion.</p>

<h2 id="6">6</h2>

<p>The transition to the cloud could in fact increase
the demand for coal and other fossil fuels despite
significant gains in energy efficiency and adoption of
a commitment to 100% renewable energy because of
the dramatic growth in new data center construction
by cloud and colocation companies such as AWS and
Digital Realty in Virginia and other hot spots that have
some of the lowest percentages of renewable electricity
in the U.S.</p>

<h2 id="7">7</h2>

<p>Faced with a lack of access to renewables in
monopoly markets, there are increasing signs
that some companies are resorting to status quo
shortcuts to reach their claims of being renewably
powered, increasing the demand for dirty energy and
undermining the continued leadership and momentum
of market leaders who are legitimately driving additional
renewable investment.</p>

<h2 id="8">8</h2>

<p>The continued lack of transparency by many
companies regarding their energy demand and the
supply of electricity powering their data centers
remains a significant threat to the sector’s long-term
sustainability. The least transparent companies such
as AWS, Tencent, LG CNS, and Baidu are also among
the most dominant in their respective markets, making
their lack of movement toward more transparency even
more egregious.</p>

<h2 id="9">9</h2>

<p>Advocacy for renewable energy is still sorely needed
in South Korea, where utility monopolies dominate the
energy market, and almost all power comes from fossil
fuels. However, progress is being made in Gangwon
Province, where the provincial government recently
decided to build the first 100% renewably powered
data center complex in Chuncheon City, thanks to the
growing demand for and public support of renewable
energy from the major IT companies in Korea.</p>
